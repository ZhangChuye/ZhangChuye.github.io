In this work, we propose a solution called S2MAT (Simultaneous and Self-Reinforced Mapping and Tracking) that integrates a frontend dynamic object detection and tracking module with a back-end static mapping module. S2MAT leverages the close and reciprocal interplay between these two modules to efficiently and effectively solve the open problem of simultaneous tracking and mapping in highly dynamic scenarios.
We conducted long-range experiments in real-world urban scenarios spanning over 7 km, which included challenging obstacles like pedestrians and other traffic agents. The successful navigation provides a comprehensive test of S2MATâ€™s robustness, scalability, efficiency, quality, and its ability to benefit autonomous robots in wild scenarios without pre-built maps.
